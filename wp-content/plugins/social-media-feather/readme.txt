Lightweight, modern looking and effective social media sharing and profile buttons and icons. All your social media needs in 1 easy package!

== Description ==

[WordPress Social Media Feather](http://socialmediafeather.com/ "Lightweight WordPress social sharing and following") is a lightweight free social media WordPress plugin that allows you to quickly and painlessly add social sharing and following features to all your posts, pages and custom post types.

The plugin supports adding of social buttons for sharing or following (that is, social buttons that link to your social network profiles pages). The social media buttons can easily and automatically be added to all your posts, pages or any other **custom post types**.

One of the few social sharing and bookmarking plugin with full support for the **Retina and high resolution displays** as used in the iPad, iPhones and other devices!

What sets WordPress Social Media Feather aside from the plethora of other social sharing and following WordPress plugins is its focus on simplicity, performance and social sharing impact. Social share buttons and links to your social pages are fast to setup with automatic display or social widgets.

Given the widespread focus on WordPress social media integration, your site will still provide social bookmarks and share buttons to improve visibility of your posts and content and improve your overall global reach on social platforms.

The **WordPress social media sharing** offered by the plugin includes all major social sharing buttons providers like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, reddit, Pinterest, tumblr, Linkedin and even e-mail.

It will show social buttons that your users can click to share to facebook or tweet your posts and pages on your site or submit it to reddit and google plus or publish it on tumblr and all other social sharing networks.

The **WordPress social media following** offered by the plugin includes all major social network providers and tools like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, Linkedin, YouTube, tumblr, instagram, flickr, foursquare, vimeo or RSS.

Our social media plugin also offers widgets for sharing and following buttons that you can place in any widgetized area in your site and the widgets also expose some settings and parameters to tweak the appearance of the social buttons. The plugin also provides shortcodes that can be used for the same purpose, creating both share and follow buttons and allowing selection of visibility of different social media networks or reordering how the various social networks appear (see example shortcodes at the bottom).

You can disable automatic rendering of social icons for specific posts by using *Custom Fields*. Simply set a custom field of `synved_social_exclude_share` to "yes" (without quotes) to disable rendering of sharing buttons on the post/page or `synved_social_exclude_follow` to "yes" (without quotes) to remove following buttons from the post or alternatively `synved_social_exclude` to disable both. The *Custom Fields* editor needs to be enabled on your post/page edit screen by clicking at the top right where it says "Screen Options".

= Example Shortcodes =

This shortcode will create a list of social sharing buttons to share content on your site:
`[feather_share]`

This shortcode will create a list of social media sharing buttons to share content on your site, only showing Google+, Twitter and Facebook, in that specific order:
`[feather_share show="google_plus, twitter, facebook" hide="reddit, pinterest, linkedin, tumblr, mail"]`

You can change the order of displayed buttons by changing the order of keywords:
`[feather_share show="twitter, google_plus, facebook" hide="reddit, pinterest, linkedin, tumblr, mail"]`

This shortcode will create a list of social sharing buttons to share content on your site using the "Wheel" icons skin:
`[feather_share skin="wheel"]`

This shortcode will create a list of social media sharing buttons to share content on your site using the default icon skin with a size of 64 pixels:
`[feather_share size="64"]`

You can add a custom CSS class to your share buttons using the "class" attribute:
`[feather_share class="myclass"]`

You can combine all the parameters above to customize the look, for instance using the "Wheel" icon skin at a size of 64 pixels and only showing Google+, Twitter and Facebook, in that specific order:
`[feather_share skin="wheel" size="64" show="google_plus, twitter, facebook" hide="reddit, pinterest, linkedin, tumblr, mail"]`

The next shortcode will create a list of social following buttons that allow visitors to follow you:
`[feather_follow]`

The next shortcode will create a list of social following buttons that allow visitors to follow you, using the "Balloon" icons skin:
`[feather_follow skin="balloon"]`

You can add a custom CSS class to your social profiles buttons using the "class" attribute:
`[feather_follow class="myclass"]`

The next shortcode will create a list of social media following buttons that allow visitors to follow you, using the "Balloon" icons skin with a size of 64 pixels:
`[feather_follow skin="balloon" size="64"]`

You can specify a manual URL to be used for the sharing buttons:
`[feather_share url="http://www.example.org"]`

= Template Tags =

If you don't want to use shortcodes but instead prefer to use PHP directly, there are 2 PHP functions/template tags you can use.

For sharing buttons you can use:
`if (function_exists('synved_social_share_markup')) echo synved_social_share_markup();`

For following buttons you can use:
`if (function_exists('synved_social_follow_markup')) echo synved_social_follow_markup();`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I see the social icons in action? =

Have a look at [our site](http://socialmediafeather.com/) or where you can see the social sharing and following features in action

= How do I disable rendering of sharing / bookmarking buttons on a specific post/page? =

You can achieve this by using *Custom Fields*. Simply set a custom field of `synved_social_exclude_share` to "yes" (without quotes) to disable share buttons on the post or page. Alternatively set `synved_social_exclude` to "yes" (without quotes) to disable both sharing and following.

= How do I disable rendering of social profiles follow buttons on a specific post/page? =

You can achieve this by using *Custom Fields*. Simply set a custom field of `synved_social_exclude_follow` to "yes" (without quotes) to remove following buttons from the post or page. Alternatively set `synved_social_exclude` to "yes" (without quotes) to disable both sharing and following.

= How do I change the Twitter button to twit the title of the post instead of the message "Hey, check this out"? =

You can achieve this by editing the Twitter Share Link under Settings -> Social Media from this:
`http://twitter.com/share?url=%%url%%&text=%%message%%`
to this:
`http://twitter.com/share?url=%%url%%&text=%%title%%`

= How do I only show sharing buttons in my sidebar, rather than under each post? =

Go to Settings -> Social Media and under "Automatic Display" uncheck "Display Sharing Buttons" as well as "Display Follow Buttons". Then go under Appearance -> Widgets and add the "Social Media Feather: Sharing" widget to your sidebar.

= How do I only show follow buttons in my sidebar, rather than under each post? =

Go to Settings -> Social Media and under "Automatic Display" uncheck "Display Sharing Buttons" as well as "Display Follow Buttons". Then go under Appearance -> Widgets and add the "Social Media Feather: Follow Us" widget to your sidebar.

= How do I show a set of custom sharing buttons on my homepage or about page? =

You can simply edit the page in question and add a [shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) like the following `[feather_share url="http://www.example.org"]`, then replace `http://www.example.org` with the URL to your site. See the next FAQ as well for adding an image.

= How do I specify a custom image for my sharing buttons shortcode? =

Just edit your [shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) so it looks like this `[feather_share url="http://www.example.org" image="http://www.example.org/image.jpg"]`, remember to substitute `http://www.example.org` with the URL to your site and the same goes for the JPEG URL.

= How do I add a set of custom social network profile icons on my homepage or about page? =

Just edit the page contents and insert another [shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) like this `[feather_follow]`.

= Facebook is not showing the correct title/description/thumbnail, what to I do? =

Social Media Feather always try to communicate to Facebook the correct parameters corresponding to the post being shared, including title and thumbnail but Facebook sometimes decides to ignore this information and instead picks up its own details from the page. This could be because some other plugin on your site is incorrectly specifying some OpenGraph tags in your page, or simply down to a Facebook choice. In both cases the solution is to remove any plugins creating incorrect OpenGraph tags and instead installing a plugin that provides proper OpenGraph tags, like [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/).

= I have an OpenGraph plugin which is creating the proper tags but Facebook is not picking them up, what do I do? =

This could be due to Facebook caching your page information. Go to [Facebook Debug Tools](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) and type in the URL to the post/page, then click "Debug". On the next screen that loads, now click on "Fetch new scraping information"; this should clear Facebook's cache of your page.

= Only some or none of the social media buttons show up, what causes it? =

If you have automatic display enabled or you're displaying the social media icons using other means, like shortcodes or widgets, but some or all the buttons are not showing up in your browser, but they do show up on a fresh install of a different browser, it is possible that some of your browser add-ons are blocking the icons. This is generally caused by ad-blocking software such as Adblock or Adblock Plus. Please add your site in the exception list for these add-ons and your social icons should show up again.

= When clicking on any share button, I'm getting an error of "The requested content cannot be loaded. Please try again later." How do I fix it? =
This is not caused by our plugin but by a lightbox library you are using. This could either be loaded by your theme or one of your other plugins. If you're using Easy Fancybox, please install their [development version](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/easy-fancybox.zip).

= I want to add/remove some margin to the social media buttons, how do I do it? =
You can achieve this by adding some CSS under Settings -> Social Media, "Extra Style" option. Add something like this inside that text area:
`.synved-social-button {
margin-left: 10px !important;
}`

If you want to just add it to the buttons as a whole instead of each individual button, then set "Buttons in Container" to "Both" and "Buttons Container Type" to "Block" and add this:
`.synved-social-container {
margin-left: 10px;
}`
